### Storage Provider Distribution
The below table shows the distribution of storage providers that have stored data for this client.

If this is the first time a provider takes verified deal, it will be marked as `new`.

For most of the datacap application, below restrictions should apply.

**Since this is the 4th allocation, the following restrictions have been relaxed:**
 - Storage provider should not exceed 50% of total datacap.
 - Storage provider should not be storing duplicate data for more than 20%.
 - Storage provider should have published its public IP address.
 - All storage providers should be located in different regions.

✔️ Storage provider distribution looks healthy.

### Deal Data Replication
The below table shows how each many unique data are replicated across storage providers.


**Since this is the 4th allocation, the following restrictions have been relaxed:**
- No more than 50% of unique data are stored with less than 4 providers.

✔️ Data replication looks healthy.

### Deal Data Shared with other Clients[^3]
The below table shows how many unique data are shared with other clients.
Usually different applications owns different data and should not resolve to the same CID.

However, this could be possible if all below clients use same software to prepare for the exact same dataset or they belong to a series of LDN applications for the same dataset.

✔️ No CID sharing has been observed.

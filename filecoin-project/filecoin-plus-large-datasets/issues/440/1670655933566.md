### Storage Provider Distribution
The below table shows the distribution of storage providers that have stored data for this client.
For most of the datacap application, below restrictions should apply. GeoIP locations are resolved with Maxmind GeoIP database.

**Since this is the 4th allocation, the following restrictions have been relaxed:**
 - Storage provider should not exceed 40% of total datacap.
 - Storage provider should not be storing duplicate data for more than 25%.
 - Storage provider should have published its public IP address.
 - The storage providers should be located in different regions.

✔️ Storage provider distribution looks healthy.

### Deal Data Replication
The below table shows how each many unique data are replicated across storage providers.

**Since this is the 4th allocation, the following restrictions have been relaxed:**
- 50% of data needs to be stored with at least 3 providers.

⚠️ 100.00% of deals are for data replicated across less than 4 storage providers.

| Number of Providers | Unique Data Size | Total Deals Made | Deal Percentage |
| ------------------: | ---------------: | ---------------: | --------------: |
|                   1 |       150.84 TiB |       150.84 TiB |         100.00% |

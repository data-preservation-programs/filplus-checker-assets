### Deal Data Shared with other Clients[^3]
The below table shows how many unique data are shared with other clients.

However, this could be possible if all below clients use same software to prepare for the exact same dataset or they belong to a series of LDN applications for the same dataset.

✔️ No CID sharing has been observed.

### Storage Provider Distribution
The below table shows the distribution of storage providers that have stored data for this client.

For most of the datacap application, below restrictions should apply.

**Since this is the 3rd allocation, the following restrictions have been relaxed:**
 - Storage provider should not exceed 70% of total datacap.
 - Storage provider should not be storing duplicate data for more than 20%.
 - Storage provider should have published its public IP address.
 - All storage providers should be located in different regions.

### Deal Data Shared with other Clients
The below table shows how many unique data are shared with other clients.

⚠️ CID sharing has been observed.

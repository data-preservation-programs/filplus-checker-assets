### Storage Provider Distribution
The below table shows the distribution of storage providers that have stored data for this client.
For most of the datacap application, below restrictions should apply.

**Since this is the 3rd allocation, the following restrictions have been relaxed:**
 - Storage provider should not exceed 50% of total datacap.
 - Storage provider should not be storing duplicate data for more than 20%.
 - Storage provider should have published its public IP address.
 - All storage providers should be located in different regions.

✔️ Storage provider distribution looks healthy.

### Deal Data Shared with other Clients
The below table shows how many unique data are shared with other clients.
Usually different applications owns different data and should not resolve to the same CID.

⚠️ CID sharing has been observed.

### Storage Provider Distribution
The below table shows the distribution of storage providers that have stored data for this client.
For most of the datacap application, below restrictions should apply. GeoIP locations are resolved with Maxmind GeoIP database.

**Since this is the 2nd allocation, the following restrictions have been relaxed:**
 - Storage provider should not exceed 90% of total datacap.
 - Storage provider should not be storing duplicate data for more than 25%.
 - Storage provider should have published its public IP address.
 - The storage providers should be located in different regions.

⚠️ All storage providers are located in the same region.

| Provider | Location | Total Deals Sealed | Percentage | Unique Data | Duplication Factor (Total Deals / Unique Data) |
| :------- | -------: | -----------------: | ---------: | ----------: | ---------------------------------------------: |

### Deal Data Replication
The below table shows how each many unique data are replicated across storage providers.

✔️ Data replication looks healthy.

| Number of Providers | Unique Data Size | Total Deals Made | Deal Percentage |

### Deal Data Shared with other Clients
The below table shows how many unique data are shared with other clients.
Usually different applications owns different data and should not resolve to the same CID.

✔️ No CID sharing has been observed.

### Deal Data Replication
The below table shows how each many unique data are replicated across storage providers.
- No more than 30% of unique data are stored with less than 4 providers.

⚠️ 100.00% of deals are for data replicated across less than 4 storage providers.

| Unique Data Size | Total Deals Made | Number of Providers | Deal Percentage |

### Deal Data Shared with other Clients
The below table shows how many unique data are shared with other clients.
Usually different applications owns different data and should not resolve to the same CID.

However, this could be possible if all below clients use same software to prepare for the exact same dataset or they belong to a series of LDN applications for the same dataset.

✔️ No CID sharing has been observed.

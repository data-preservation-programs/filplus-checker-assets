### Storage Provider Distribution
The below table shows the distribution of storage providers that have stored data for this client.

If this is the first time a provider takes verified deal, it will be marked as `new`.

For most of the datacap application, below restrictions should apply.

**Since this is the 4th allocation, the following restrictions have been relaxed:**
 - Storage provider should not exceed 50% of total datacap.
 - Storage provider should not be storing duplicate data for more than 20%.
 - Storage provider should have published its public IP address.
 - All storage providers should be located in different regions.

✔️ Storage provider distribution looks healthy.

✔️ No CID sharing has been observed.

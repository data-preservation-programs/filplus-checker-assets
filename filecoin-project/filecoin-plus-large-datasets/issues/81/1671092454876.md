### Storage Provider Distribution
The below table shows the distribution of storage providers that have stored data for this client.

If this is the first time a provider takes verified deal, it will be marked as `new`.

For most of the datacap application, below restrictions should apply.

**Since this is the 2nd allocation, the following restrictions have been relaxed:**
 - Storage provider should not exceed 90% of total datacap.
 - Storage provider should not be storing duplicate data for more than 20%.
 - Storage provider should have published its public IP address.
 - All storage providers should be located in different regions.

⚠️ 35.62% of total deal sealed by [f01611281](https://filfox.info/en/address/f01611281) are duplicate data.

⚠️ 30.43% of total deal sealed by [f01828679](https://filfox.info/en/address/f01828679) are duplicate data.

⚠️ All storage providers are located in the same region.

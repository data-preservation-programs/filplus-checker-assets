### Storage Provider Distribution
The below table shows the distribution of storage providers that have stored data for this client.
For most of the datacap application, below restrictions should apply. GeoIP locations are resolved with Maxmind GeoIP database.
 - Storage provider should not exceed 25% of total datacap.
 - Storage provider should not be storing duplicate data for more than 25%.
 - Storage provider should have published its public IP address.
 - The storage providers should be located in different regions.

✔️ Storage provider distribution looks healthy.

### Deal Data Replication
The below table shows how each many unique data are replicated across storage providers.
- 75% of data needs to be stored with at least 3 providers.

⚠️ 63.42% of deals are for data replicated across less than 4 storage providers.

### Deal Data Shared with other Clients
The below table shows how many unique data are shared with other clients.
Usually different applications owns different data and should not resolve to the same CID.

⚠️ CID sharing has been observed.
